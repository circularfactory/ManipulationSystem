<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown"><p>The manipulation system combines physical hardware, control logic, and a learning-based grasp learning system to facilitate autonomous, versatile and adaptive object manipulation. The Manipulator executes actions in the environment using a robotic arm with a parallel-jaw gripper and sensors, capturing proprioceptive and exteroceptive data to inform grasp and trajectory planning. The grasp learning system processes this data for continuous learning, inference, and real-time adaptive grasp prediction, leveraging both real-world and simulated environments. Together, these components establish a closed-loop, data-driven framework that supports (object-centric) manipulation in dynamic intralogistics environments.</p>
