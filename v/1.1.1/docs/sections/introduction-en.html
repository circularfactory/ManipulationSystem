<span class="markdown"><p>Within the modular intralogistic system, the ManipulatorModule extends the system’s capabilities beyond transportation and buffering by enabling the active handling of components. While the MobileRobots provide mobility to all Modules and the TransportModule ensures buffering and relocation, many tasks in the circular factory require grasping, repositioning, or orienting components – capabilities that only the ManipulatorModule provides. A key strength lies in its versatility: it can operate as a mobile unit, mounted on a MobileRobot to perform manipulation tasks throughout the shop floor, or used as a stationary pick-and-place robot at fixed locations. This dual mode enables flexible system design, efficient resource usage, and a highly automated material flow.</p>
<p>Besides extending functionality of the intralogistics system, the Manipulation System can also be integrated with other subsystems, to extent their capabilities.</p>
